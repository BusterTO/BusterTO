My name is Hamza Ali, and I am a freelance app developer with expertise in Flutter, Firebase, Python, and Java. Over the past three years, I have developed several applications, including social media, travel, DBMS, trip planning, and interior design apps, as well as an open-source music player. Additionally, I have earned certifications in JavaScript, Java, Python, Flutter, Firebase, UI/UX design, and more.

Currently, I am working on Tabeeb, a medical remedy app that utilizes Python machine learning for personalized recommendations. As my final-year project, I am also developing a career consultation app that matches individuals to careers based on their skills and interests using AI. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Software Engineering at IMSciences, where I have gained valuable programming skills and further developed my expertise.

In addition to my software development work, I am strongly interested in computer hardware and IT technology. I maintain a small home lab where I experiment with various hardware components and configurations, allowing me to deepen my understanding of IT systems and stay updated with the latest technological advancements.

Looking ahead, I am pursuing a certification in Python Flask for Flutter backend development, aiming to become a full-stack developer. I have also built a comprehensive portfolio website to showcase my work and accomplishments. I am always exploring new technologies and look forward to making a positive impact in software engineering.
